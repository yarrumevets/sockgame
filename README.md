## Introduction

I built this little game to provide the foundation for an multiplayer online real-time web game.

## Tech

- Vanilla JS - This app was initially intended as a very minimalist POC for demonstrating integration with the Google Docs API.
- Node Express - A very simple express server with endpoints for downloading the document in the various file types.
- GoogleAPIs Node.js client - For authenticating and fetching the document in text and binary formats

## Features

This POC/boilerplate game can be used as a starting point for a web game that requires:

- Real-time - Frame-level accuracy
- Server-side source of truth - Game state and animation loop are controlled by the server
- Multi-player - Clients are added to a socket connection list
- Animation - Animation loop in canvas on the client
- Input - Capture keyboard key states

## Roadmap

Features I plan to include:

- Websocket client list queue on the side, indicating which clients are players
- End-game logic that resets the game
- A module that provides some basic collision-detection functions
